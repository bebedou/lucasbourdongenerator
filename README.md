This project was made for learning purpose, based on Tensorflow tutorials to learn how a RNN and text generation works.
To launch the program, you have to launch the test.py script (Should have come up with a better name)
Then you have the UI displayed and you can just follow the instructions.
Note that the model training takes A WHILE (several hours) so don't be impatient.

The outcome of this project is a generated text based on the one you used to train it. It reproduces vocabulary and style.
